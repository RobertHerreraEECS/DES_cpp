# DES Encryption

DES Encryption is a c++ based application that aims to re-work an initial implementation of the DES encryption scheme I did a few years ago. 


## Notes

* Ensure cmake is installed on your machine. You may need to modify the cmake file for right now if your machine is not on MAC OSX



## TODO

* Investigate cause of memory leak in the initial implementation. 
* Fix cmake RPATH issue with shared libraries
* Rework functions as necessary # DES_cpp
